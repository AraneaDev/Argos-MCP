# Changelog

All notable changes to the Argos-MCP will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [4.0.0](https://github.com/AraneaDev/Argos-MCP/compare/v3.0.1...v4.0.0) (2026-08-10)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* close SELECT-only and TLS bypasses, fail secure on unreadable config ([#7](https://github.com/AraneaDev/Argos-MCP/issues/7))

  **Unreadable booleans in `config.ini` now fail at startup.** Only
  `true/1/yes/on/enabled` and `false/0/no/off/disabled` are accepted; anything
  else raises a `ConfigValidationError` naming the database and the field.
  Previously an unrecognised value was read as `false`, which put it on the
  dangerous side of three security settings: `select_only = yes` granted write
  access, `ssl_verify = yes` disabled certificate checking, and
  `ssh_strict_host_key_checking = yes` disabled host-key checking. Check your
  `config.ini` before upgrading. Configurations written by `npm run setup` or
  copied from the template only ever contain `true`/`false` and are unaffected.

  **Audit records moved** from `~/.sql-ts/audit` to `~/.argos-mcp/audit`.
  Existing files are left in place rather than relocated; move or archive them
  yourself if you need one continuous history.

  **`ssl_verify` in the `add_database` and `update_database` tools accepts only
  a literal `true`,** and any other value is now rejected with an error. The
  guard previously tested `=== false`, so the JSON string `"false"`, the number
  `0` and `"no"` all passed it, were stored, and then disabled certificate
  verification once an adapter coerced them. Turning verification off is a
  deliberate change to make in `config.ini`, not something a tool call should be
  able to do.

### Bug Fixes

* close SELECT-only and TLS bypasses, fail secure on unreadable config ([#7](https://github.com/AraneaDev/Argos-MCP/issues/7)) ([8a0e085](https://github.com/AraneaDev/Argos-MCP/commit/8a0e085facdfec3815ac2bb493f2f6a17bce7ef7))

## [3.0.1](https://github.com/AraneaDev/Argos-MCP/compare/v3.0.0...v3.0.1) (2026-08-09)


### Bug Fixes

* **performance:** stop discarding MySQL EXPLAIN columns ([#5](https://github.com/AraneaDev/Argos-MCP/issues/5)) ([65e234f](https://github.com/AraneaDev/Argos-MCP/commit/65e234f82465f47ff582cfe94c738dd859b979b9))

## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/AraneaDev/Argos-MCP/compare/v2.7.2...v3.0.0) (2026-08-09)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* package renamed sql-access -> argos-mcp; binaries renamed mcp-sql-server -> argos-mcp and mcp-sql-setup -> argos-setup; the mcp-sql-install binary is removed; Claude Desktop is no longer supported; the log file is now argos-mcp.log. Re-register the server with `claude mcp add argos --scope user -- node <path>/dist/index.js --config <path>/config.ini`.

### Features

* rebrand to Argos-MCP and adopt native Claude Code registration ([e51fde6](https://github.com/AraneaDev/Argos-MCP/commit/e51fde6f858f566c80043211b7091406259f314b))

### Detail

Rebrand to **Argos-MCP**, and a move from a bespoke installer to Claude Code's
native MCP registration. Named for Argos Panoptes, the hundred-eyed giant — one
server watching many databases at once. Joins Chaos-MCP and Knossos-MCP under
the same naming scheme.

The full suite (1340 tests) passes, `lint:check`, `format:check`, `type-check`
and `validate-docs` are clean.

### Changed — BREAKING
- **Package renamed** from `sql-access` to `argos-mcp`. The MCP server
  identifier (`SERVER_NAME`) is now `argos-mcp`.
- **Binaries renamed:** `mcp-sql-server` → `argos-mcp`, `mcp-sql-setup` →
  `argos-setup`. Re-register the server after upgrading.
- **Registration is now `claude mcp add`.** Claude Code owns its MCP registry;
  the server is added with
  `claude mcp add argos --scope user -- node <path>/dist/index.js --config <path>/config.ini`.
- **Log file renamed** from `sql-mcp-server.log` to `argos-mcp.log`.
- Repository moved to `AraneaDev/Argos-MCP`.

MCP tool names are deliberately unchanged — `sql_query`, `sql_get_schema`,
`sql_add_database` and the rest keep their names, so only the namespace shifts
(`mcp__sql-access__sql_query` → `mcp__argos__sql_query`).

### Removed — BREAKING
- **`src/install.ts` and the `mcp-sql-install` binary.** The hand-rolled
  installer edited `~/.claude.json` and `claude_desktop_config.json` as raw
  JSON, duplicating what the Claude Code CLI does natively and drifting from it.
- **Claude Desktop support.** All `claude_desktop_config.json` handling, example
  configs, and integration docs are gone; Claude Code is the only documented
  client.
- **`scripts/bump-version.sh`**, superseded by release-please.
- Documentation references to commands that never existed as bin entries
  (`sql-test-connections`, `sql-validate-config`, `sql-generate-schema`,
  `sql-benchmark`, `argos-start`, `argos-test`). Connection testing, schema
  inspection, and performance analysis are MCP tools, not shell commands.

### Added
- **release-please** (`release-please-config.json`,
  `.release-please-manifest.json`, `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`).
  Releases are cut from Conventional Commits; version references in
  `src/types/index.ts`, `README.md`, `docs/api/typescript-api.md` and
  `docs/tutorials/01-installation.md` are rewritten automatically.
- **`.github/workflows/pr-title.yml`** — rejects pull request titles that are
  not Conventional Commits. A squash merge takes the PR title as the commit
  subject, so an unclassifiable title silently skips a release.
- **Rebuilt CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): lint/format/typecheck report
  independently rather than short-circuiting, tests run on Node 20/22/24, and
  the build job asserts both bin targets exist and runs `validate-docs`.
- **Proper git hooks.** `pre-commit` refuses commits on `main`/`master`, blocks
  staged credential files (`config.ini`, `*.pem`, SSH keys) and content
  containing `BEGIN ... PRIVATE KEY`, then runs `lint-staged`. `commit-msg`
  enforces Conventional Commits. `pre-push` runs the full `validate` gate.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** documenting the commit format, hooks, and release flow.
- `repository`, `homepage`, and `bugs` fields in `package.json`.

## [2.7.2] - 2026-07-07

Tooling and supply-chain follow-up to the 2.7.1 release, which failed CI on an
unformatted diff. No runtime/behaviour changes; the full unit suite (1340 tests)
passes and `npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities.

### Fixed
- Reformatted `src/database/adapters/mysql.ts` and
  `tests/unit/security-manager.test.ts` with Prettier so `format:check`
  (and the release pipeline) passes.

### Security
- Bumped the `esbuild` dev dependency to `0.28.1`, clearing the dev-server
  arbitrary-file-read advisory (GHSA-g7r4-m6w7-qqqr).
- Added a `qs` override (`^6.15.2`) to lift the transitive dev-only copy pulled
  in via `@stryker-mutator/core` past the `qs.stringify` DoS
  (GHSA-q8mj-m7cp-5q26).

### Added
- Husky + lint-staged pre-commit hook that runs Prettier on staged
  `src`/`tests` TypeScript and ESLint `--fix` on staged `src`, so unformatted
  code can no longer reach CI. Installs automatically via the `prepare` script.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-07-07

Follow-up remediation of audit findings C1, H1–H6, and M4, with the full unit
suite (1340 tests) passing.

### Security
- **C1**: `SecurityManager` now matches database-specific metadata commands by
  exact name instead of substring, and no longer early-returns them past the
  write-keyword and dangerous-pattern scans. A stored proc whose name merely
  contains an allowed fragment (e.g. `sp_helpdesk_reset` containing `sp_help`)
  can no longer bypass validation.
- **H1**: Config-mutating tools validate all inputs before touching the live
  config object, so a validation failure can no longer leave the in-memory
  config poisoned (pointing at a traversal path or invalid value) until restart.
- **H5**: Extended the cache mutation regex (`MERGE`, `UPSERT`, `GRANT`,
  `REVOKE`, `ATTACH`, `DETACH`, `VACUUM`, `REINDEX`, `COPY`) so these no longer
  leave cached SELECT results stale, and blocked `COPY` (a PostgreSQL server-side
  file-I/O / `FROM PROGRAM` RCE primitive) even in full-access mode.

### Fixed
- **H2**: Unregistering a database now invalidates its query cache, so stale
  results from the old config/host are not served after an update or removal.
- **H3**: Connection pools are now captured before the close loop, so
  `destroyPool()` actually runs on shutdown instead of iterating an
  already-emptied map and leaking pools/TCP connections.
- **H4**: The MySQL adapter inspects the underlying socket state to detect dead
  connections (`typeof execute === 'function'` stayed true on a closed socket),
  so `getConnection` transparently recreates them.
- **H6**: A failed query inside a transaction now rolls back, stops, and returns
  the partial per-query results (consistent with non-transaction mode) instead
  of throwing and discarding the breakdown.
- **M4**: `SchemaManager` keys cached schemas by the original database name
  stored in the schema JSON rather than the sanitized filename, so a database
  named e.g. `db/prod` is found after a restart.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-07-05

Follow-up security audit of v2.6.3 (see `SECURITY-AUDIT.md`): 24 findings remediated
(1 critical, 3 high, 8 medium, plus low/info), with real-database verification of the
streaming and timeout work.

### Security
- Fixed a **critical** SELECT-only bypass on PostgreSQL: the validator stripped `#` line
  comments for all engines (a MySQL-only rule), hiding a stacked `; DROP …` that pg's simple
  query protocol then executed. `#` is now only treated as a comment for MySQL/MariaDB.
- Blocked additional MSSQL write/admin statement verbs (`UPDATETEXT`, `WRITETEXT`, `DBCC`,
  `KILL`, `RECONFIGURE`, `CHECKPOINT`, `SHUTDOWN`, `WAITFOR`, `OPENROWSET`, …) that could ride
  after a leading `SELECT` via T-SQL's optional semicolons.
- Schema/connection tools (`sql_test_connection`, `sql_get_schema`, `sql_refresh_schema`,
  `sql_list_databases`) now sanitize driver errors before returning them, so DB usernames and
  internal host/IP details no longer reach the client.
- Field redaction resolves aliased/expression columns to their source column, so
  `SELECT ssn AS x` can no longer bypass a redaction rule; `sql_get_config` no longer discloses
  the redaction ruleset.
- Error sanitizer now masks email addresses, internal `host:port`, and DB usernames.
- Standalone `ANALYZE` is no longer allowed on PostgreSQL in SELECT-only mode.
- SELECT-only SQLite databases are opened read-only; an optional `SQL_MCP_SQLITE_BASE_DIR`
  rooted allowlist constrains model-supplied file/key paths.
- `ssl_verify=false` is rejected from the MCP config tools (disabling TLS verification requires
  a manual `config.ini` edit).
- Hardened logging: log/audit files created `0600` (and tightened on pre-existing files),
  tool-call query text/params and secret-shaped strings scrubbed before writing.
- Config-mutating MCP tools are serialized with a mutex; `config.ini` is written atomically
  via a unique temp filename.
- Removed the stray `peerDependencies.node` entry that caused npm to install a userland `node`
  package with a network-fetching preinstall script.

### Added
- Server-side statement timeouts: MySQL sets `SET SESSION max_execution_time`
  (`max_statement_time` fallback on MariaDB); SQLite calls `db.interrupt()` on the query
  timeout to abort a runaway statement instead of only abandoning it client-side.
- Pre-materialization row bounding: MySQL and SQLite stream results and retain only `max_rows`,
  so a large result set no longer fully materializes in the Node heap; the true `rowCount` and
  a `truncated` flag are still reported.
- Live-database integration tests (`tests/integration/live-adapters.test.ts`, env-gated) and a
  real-DB SQLite verification script (`scripts/verify-sqlite-streaming.cjs`).

### Fixed
- **SQLite and MSSQL adapters crashed on connect under the ESM build** — `sqlite3`/`mssql` are
  CommonJS modules whose value exports (`Database`, `ConnectionPool`) are reachable only via
  `.default` under Node ESM, so `import * as x; x.Foo` was `undefined`. Two of the four database
  backends were non-functional in the production build; fixed by resolving the CJS `.default`.
- MSSQL positional-placeholder (`?` → `@paramN`) conversion now correctly handles `''`/`""`
  escaped quotes and `[…]` bracket identifiers, so a literal `?` inside a string/identifier no
  longer shifts parameter numbering.

## [2.6.3] - 2026-07-04

### Changed
- `bump-version.sh` now promotes the `## [Unreleased]` CHANGELOG section to the released version, syncs version references in `docs/api/typescript-api.md` and `docs/tutorials/01-installation.md`, and refuses to release when the `[Unreleased]` section is missing or empty

### Fixed
- Backfilled missing CHANGELOG entries (2.4.4 through 2.6.2) and corrected stale version references in the TypeScript API and installation docs

## [2.6.2] - 2026-07-04

### Changed
- Applied Prettier formatting to satisfy the `format:check` CI gate

### Removed
- Stopped tracking `CLAUDE.md` in git and added it to `.gitignore`

## [2.6.1] - 2026-07-04

### Changed
- Hardened `utils` unit tests to a 100% mutation score (via chaos-mcp)

## [2.6.0] - 2026-07-04

Remediation of security audit findings (3 critical, 8 high, 6 medium, 3 low from `SECURITY-AUDIT.md`).

### Added
- SSH remote host key verification with fingerprint pinning (fails closed)

### Changed
- SELECT-only enforcement now also guards `sql_analyze_performance` and rejects data-modifying CTEs, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, `COPY ... PROGRAM`, stacked statements, and embedded write keywords (leading-token check)
- Fail-secure config defaults: `select_only` defaults to `true`, `ssl_verify` preserves `undefined` so TLS cert validation stays on, and MCP-added databases are always read-only
- SSH hardening: dropped SHA-1 KEX/HMAC, gated debug trace behind `SSH_DEBUG`, warn on non-loopback bind
- Honor configured `max_rows`; added PostgreSQL `statement_timeout`; wrapped batch/analyze in the query timeout; MSSQL placeholder replacement now skips string literals

### Fixed
- Redact secret fields before logging tool args; log/config files written `0600`; non-destructive, size-capped log rotation; atomic config writes
- Client-facing errors routed through `sanitizeMessage` (bearer tokens, passphrases, PEM); redaction now fails closed

### Security
- `npm audit fix` (6 of 7 advisories); documented the HTTP-transport auth caveat

## [2.5.3] - 2026-05-25

### Changed
- Extracted adapter construction into a dedicated `AdapterFactory` with logic and security refinements for database adapters and sanitization

- Renamed repository references and URLs to `argos-mcp`

### Fixed
- `sql_test_connection` now reports the actual connection status

### Security
- Sanitize database names in schema file paths; set restrictive (`0600`) permissions on schema files

## [2.5.1] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- Audit logging of config changes made via MCP tools

### Security
- Validate queries even when `select_only` is false
- Block `select_only` changes via MCP tools
- Block MySQL version-conditional comment bypass
- Validate database names to prevent INI injection
- Validate config in `handleAddDatabase`
- Validate SQLite file paths against traversal

### Fixed

## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Circuit Breaker** - Automatic failure detection with open/half-open/closed state machine and `CircuitOpenError`
- **Query Cache** - TTL-LRU cache with per-database partitioning and automatic mutation invalidation
- **MetricsManager** - Per-database latency, error rate, circuit breaker, and cache hit/miss tracking
- **`sql_get_metrics` Tool** - New MCP tool exposing in-memory performance metrics
- **Audit Logger** - Structured audit logging with `audit_log` and `cache_ttl_seconds` config fields
- **Database Config Validation** - `validateDatabaseConfig` with host, port, and database name checks
- **SSH Key Permission Checks** - Validates private key file permissions before loading
- **Connection Pooling** - PostgreSQL pooling via `pg.Pool` and MySQL pooling via `mysql2 createPool`

### Changed
- Circuit breaker, query cache, and metrics integrated into `ConnectionManager.executeQuery` pipeline
- `MetricsManager` and `QueryCache` instantiated in `SQLMCPServer` and wired into `ConnectionManager`
- Replaced non-null assertions and type assertions in adapters with typed local consts

### Fixed
- Unsafe internal property access in `isConnected` checks replaced with safe alternatives
- Swallowed errors in SSH port suggestion fallback now logged
- Flaky timing assertion in connection-manager test converted to fake timers

### Security
- Block `EXEC`/`CALL`/stored procedure execution in non-SELECT mode

- All 11 test suites now pass (416 tests)

## [2.4.1] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- Resolved log and schema file paths to project root instead of current working directory
- Fixed stdout contamination and config path failures causing random MCP connection drops

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-14

- ESLint JSDoc plugin enforcing documentation on public API surface
- `@typescript-eslint/recommended` ruleset with strict type checking
- `eqeqeq` and `no-throw-literal` lint rules
- Per-connection and per-tunnel 5-second timeouts during cleanup

### Changed
- **Breaking up the god class**: Extracted SQLMCPServer (1,637 lines) into focused modules:
  - `src/tools/tool-definitions.ts` - MCP tool JSON schemas
  - `src/tools/dispatcher.ts` - Tool call routing
  - `src/tools/handlers/query-handlers.ts` - Query, batch, and performance tools
  - `src/tools/handlers/schema-handlers.ts` - Schema, list, test, and refresh tools
  - `src/tools/handlers/config-handlers.ts` - Database CRUD and config tools
  - `src/utils/response-formatter.ts` - Table and summary formatting
- SQLMCPServer reduced to ~330 lines (lifecycle + config parsing only)
- `closeAllConnections()` and `closeAllTunnels()` now use `Promise.allSettled` instead of `Promise.all`
- Uncaught exception/rejection handlers now route through `gracefulShutdown()` instead of `process.exit(1)`
- Replaced all `any` types with proper types across the codebase (0 ESLint warnings)

### Fixed
- Duplicate `process.on('exit')` and `process.on('SIGINT')` handlers in EnhancedSSHTunnelManager competing with main shutdown handler
- Async cleanup in sync `process.on('exit')` handler that could never complete
- `server.cleanup()` hanging forever if a connection/tunnel refused to close
- Schema manager tests updated to match compact schema output format
- Integration test compilation errors restored
- Strict equality violation in RedactionManager

### Removed
- Dead `SSHTunnelManager.ts` (512 lines) - never imported by production code, registered competing signal handlers
- Unused imports: `createHash`, `RedactionType`, `FieldPatternType`, `isValidFieldPatternType`

## [2.3.1] - 2026-03-11

### Changed
- **`sql_get_schema` Compact Output** - Schema output now adapts based on size: large schemas (>200 columns) show a compact summary with table names, column counts, and key columns; small schemas show full inline column details. This prevents output from exceeding MCP token limits on large databases.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Dynamic Database Management via MCP** - Add, update, and remove database configurations at runtime using MCP tools
- **`sql_add_database` Tool** - Add new databases via MCP with automatic `mcp_configurable=true` and `select_only=true` defaults
- **`sql_update_database` Tool** - Modify database settings (host, port, credentials, SSL, SSH) via MCP for configurable databases
- **`sql_remove_database` Tool** - Remove databases via MCP, including disconnection and SSH tunnel cleanup
- **`sql_get_config` Tool** - View database configuration with automatic password/credential redaction
- **`sql_set_mcp_configurable` Tool** - One-way lock mechanism to prevent MCP configuration changes (unlocking requires manual config edit)
- **`mcp_configurable` Configuration Flag** - Per-database flag controlling whether MCP tools can modify the database settings
- **`argos-install` CLI Installer** - Automatic installer that configures Claude Code and Claude Desktop MCP integration
- **Platform Detection** - Installer auto-detects macOS, Windows, and Linux config file locations
- **Default Config Location** - New default config path at `~/.config/argos/config.ini` for installed usage

### Changed
- **`DatabaseConfig` Interface** - Added `mcp_configurable?: boolean` field
- **`DatabaseListItem` Interface** - Added `mcp_configurable: boolean` field
- **`sql_list_databases` Output** - Now shows MCP configurable status for each database
- **Config Persistence** - `saveConfigFile()` now writes `mcp_configurable` flag
- **`SQLMCPServer`** - Stores config file path as instance variable for runtime config persistence
- **`ConnectionManager`** - `createDatabaseListItems()` includes `mcp_configurable` in output
- **`package.json`** - Added `argos-install` bin entry and `install-mcp` npm script
- **esbuild Config** - Updated to bundle `install.ts` entry point
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive updates across README, API reference, configuration guide, installation guide, tutorials, and architecture docs

### Security
- **One-Way Lock Design** - `sql_set_mcp_configurable` can only lock (set to false), preventing AI from re-enabling its own config access
- **Credential Redaction** - `sql_get_config` always redacts passwords, SSH keys, and passphrases
- **Safe Defaults** - Manually-configured databases default to `mcp_configurable=false`; MCP-created databases default to `select_only=true`
- **Config Mutation Logging** - All configuration changes via MCP are logged

### Testing
- **456 tests passing** (up from 437)
- **Test fixture updates** - Updated `DatabaseListItem` test fixtures for `mcp_configurable` field

### Breaking Changes
- **None** - This release is fully backward compatible with v2.2.x. Existing databases without `mcp_configurable` default to `false` (locked).

### Migration Guide
No migration required. Existing configurations work without changes. To enable MCP configuration for existing databases, add `mcp_configurable=true` to the desired `[database.*]` sections in config.ini.
